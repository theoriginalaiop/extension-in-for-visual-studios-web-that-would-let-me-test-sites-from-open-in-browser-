// Creating a Visual Studio Code extension that lets you test websites, 
by opening them directly in the browser can be a great tool for your development workflow. 
Below is a step-by-step guide to create such an extension. Step 1: Set Up Your Development 
Environment First, make sure you have these prerequisites:
Visual Studio Code installed.Node.js and npm installed.
Visual Studio Code Extension Generator (yo code), which will help you scaffold the extension.
Install (yo) and (generator-code): Step 2: Scaffold the Extension
Open a terminal/command prompt. Run the following command to generate the extension template:
bash Copy code, You'll be prompted to answer some questions. Choose the following options:
What type of extension do you want to create? Choose New Extension (TypeScript).
What’s the name of your extension? Enter something like open-in-browser.
What’s the identifier for your extension? This will be open-in-browser or any name you prefer.
What’s the description of your extension? Enter a description, like Open websites in browser directly from VS Code.
What kind of extension do you want to create? Choose No when asked for a template with specific features (e.g., commands).
After completing the prompts, navigate into your extension's folder:
Step 3: Implement the Functionality Open the src/extension.ts file, which contains the main logic for the extension.
In the activate function, you can add a command that will open the current URL in the browser. Here's the code you can add:
Install the open package by running the following in the terminal:
Step 4: Update the package.json You need to add the command definition to the package.json file to ensure Visual Studio Code recognizes it.
In the package.json file, add the command under the contributes.commands section. The updated package.json might look like this:
* code is in the folder* "just read da fuckn instructions godammit"
Step 5: Compile the TypeScript Run the following command to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript:
bash *Copy the code in folder* Step 6: Test the Extension Locally Open Visual Studio Code in the extension folder.
Press F5 to open a new VS Code window with your extension loaded.
In the new window, try selecting a URL in any file, right-click, and choose Open URL in Browser from the context menu.
The selected URL should open in your default browser.
Step 7: Packaging and Publishing (Optional) If you'd like to share your extension with others,
you can package publish it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
Install vsce, the Visual Studio Code Extension CLI: 
Package the extension: Publish to the marketplace (you'll need a publisher account):
Summary This extension allows you to select a URL in any document,
and with a right-click context menu, it will open that URL directly in your browser.
It uses the open package to manage opening the browser and is built with TypeScript using the Visual Studio Code extension API. Future Enhancements
Auto-reload: Use a file watcher like chokidar to refresh the browser on file changes.
Preview inside VS Code: Integrate a webview panel to preview the website directly in the editor.
Multi-browser Testing: Add support to launch URLs in multiple browsers simultaneously.

======> oh yea i forgot, publish on the VS Code Marketplace: Create an account on the Azure DevOps portal and link it to your Visual Studio Marketplace account. Then: vcse publish
